# Software Design and Engineering Artifact

For my Software Design and Engineering artifact, I selected the **Animal Rescue Inventory System**, originally built as a Java-based console program. I enhanced the project by redeveloping it as a full-stack web application using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Handlebars**. This updated version allows users to intake, search, update, and delete animal records through a web interface, while persisting data in a MongoDB database.

The enhancements showcase several key skills, including full-stack development, MVC design, data validation, and user-focused features. I implemented filtering and search functionality, added auto-capitalization for inputs, preserved intake dates when editing, and improved usability through theme toggling and form state retention. These changes reflect thoughtful engineering decisions that balance functionality, user experience, and maintainability.

This artifact meets the outcome goals I set earlier in the course by demonstrating my ability to design, build, and refine a realistic application using modern development tools. Throughout the enhancement process, I strengthened my debugging and planning skills, and learned the importance of iterating on feedback to improve both code quality and user experience. This project now stands as a complete and professional artifact for my ePortfolio.

There are still a few features that will be implemented over the remaining weeks of the course. One being the account management system needs to be redefined. Right now, there is only one working account, the admin account. Moving forward, I will redesign this to allow for separate accounts to be created and allow for more users to have access to the application. I also need to add a “Forgot Password” feature to make this applicable to the real world. The filter options also work as they should, but in my opinion the layout isn’t exactly visually appealing and could be redefined to include more filterable items and a better UI/UX.
