## Data Structures and Algorithms

Like last week, I have chosen to use my Animal Rescue Inventory System as my artifact. This project was originally a Java application that ran solely in the console. The system handled the intake, tracking, and reservation of dogs and monkeys through a menu-driven interface using an ArrayList data structure. For this enhancement, I rebuilt the entire system as a full-stack web application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

I selected this artifact because it clearly demonstrates my ability to design and work with data structures, as well as apply algorithmic thinking in both procedural and web-based contexts. The enhanced version showcases my understanding of object modeling, logic control, and adapting data storage from in-memory structures to persistent database schemas. Migrating the core logic from basic list iterations to MongoDB queries significantly improved the performance and scalability of the system.

I believe I have successfully met all the goals I established in Module One. Through this enhancement, I demonstrated my understanding of data structures and algorithms by implementing features such as search, filter, and modification functions. Additionally, I expanded my skill set by learning how to implement asynchronous logic in database operations and by redesigning the application’s architecture to follow principles like separation of concerns. While there were a few minor updates to the original coverage plan during development, none strayed far from the intended goals. This experience gave me a much deeper understanding of both backend and full-stack web development.

The enhancement process taught me how to translate abstract data models into a working, real-world backend system. I also had to rethink how my original search and reservation logic would function within a non-linear data store like MongoDB. One of the biggest challenges I faced was maintaining the logical integrity of the original system while making such a significant transformation. Adapting to the event-driven, asynchronous nature of Node.js required a shift in how I approached function flow, especially around database reads and writes.

Overall, this enhancement allowed me to deepen my skills in data structures and algorithms by bridging the gap between classroom knowledge and real-world application. I’ve gained valuable experience that I can apply not only to future academic projects but also to potential career opportunities in web development.
