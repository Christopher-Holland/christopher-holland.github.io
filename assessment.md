# Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have built a strong foundation in software engineering, data structures, databases, and security. Completing coursework, collaborating on projects, and developing this ePortfolio allowed me to apply technical knowledge to real-world problems. Specifically, the featured project gave me creative freedom to build an application that tested my abilities while solving practical challenges.

I honed **problem-solving and algorithm design** skills through the Animal Rescue Inventory System by implementing efficient data structures to manage, search, and reserve animals. I also transformed a simple console application into a full-stack web app using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Handlebars. With security in mind, I integrated features such as password hashing and JWT authentication to ensure a robust and safe program.

I chose to focus on this single artifact from my previous classwork because it demonstrates a wide range of skills in one cohesive project. The **code review video** showcases my ability to communicate technical concepts and identify opportunities for improvement in existing code. The ePortfolio itself provides a structured overview of my growth over the last seven weeks, with each section reflecting my weekly accomplishments. Together, these artifacts illustrate both my technical competence and my commitment to continuous learning.

In summary, my experiences at Southern New Hampshire University have equipped me with valuable skills, a strong professional mindset, and the confidence to succeed in the field of software engineering. This ePortfolio offers a snapshot of what I have accomplished and what I am capable of achieving in my career.
