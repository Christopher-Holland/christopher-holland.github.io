For milestone four, I again went with my Animal Rescue Inventory System. This was originally meant to be a console-based application that allowed for the intake, tracking, and reservation of animals. This lacked a graphical interface, database integration, and secure authentication. I selected this because it offered a great opportunity to expand its functionality by adding in a database and secure user authentication. 
The primary enhancement for this project was migrating the application to a full-stack web solution using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I designed and implemented a MongoDB schema to store user accounts, animal records, and password reset tokens. This provides persistent storage and improved scalability compared to the in-memory data handling in the original version. To ensure security, I incorporated bcrypt hashing for password storage, session-based authentication, and password reset workflow using secure, randomly generated tokens with expiration times. 
Additionally, I implemented server-side input validation using the express-validator library. This prevents invalid or malicious data from being stored in the database by enforcing rules such as minimum password length, valid email format, and matching password confirmation fields. These are safeguards that protect both data and application security. 
From a database perspective, this weekâ€™s enhancement demonstrates my abilities to design, implement, and integrate a MongoDB database securely and functionally. From a software engineering standpoint, it showcases my understanding of modernizing outdated systems into a maintainable, scalable, and secure full-stack system. 
This work reflects progress towards the all of the course outcomes. It demonstrates my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that address real-world needs, apply professional database practices, and implement secure coding strategies. Overall the enhancements made to this artifact now allow it to represent a fully functioning, database driven web application with the capability to offer real value to users in the real-world.
